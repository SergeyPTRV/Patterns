# C++ Design Patterns Library

This repository contains high-quality implementations of common software design patterns in C++. These examples focus on clean code, memory management, and architectural best practices relevant to complex systems.

## 🚀 Existing Patterns

### Creational Patterns
* **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
* **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `AbstractFactory.cpp`
* `Builder.cpp`
* `FactoryMethod.cpp`

## 🛠 Future Updates
This is an ongoing project. I will be adding more patterns in the future, including Structural and Behavioral patterns (e.g., Singleton, Observer, Strategy).

## 💻 Environment
* Language: C++17/20
* Compiler: GCC / Clang / MSVC
